--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
writespeed 	- file writing in few threads at same time
odpulse	   	- receiving data from odp in few threads, then writing it in few files (with internal speed measure)
odwriter   	- receiving odp data in few threads, then adding all buffers in single queue, and
	     	  dequeue from additional writer thread. so we write in single file only
odnvmepulse	- receiving data from odp in few threads, then writing it in few files with spdk nvme driver 
odnvmepulse17	- same as above, but works with SPDK legacy API from 2017
tracepulse	- parallel libtrace input processing
tracepulspdk	- parallel libtrace input processing with using SPDK as a buffer for storing data





use 4.9.X gcc and build tracepulspdk

PATH=/opt/rh/devtoolset-3/root/usr/bin:$PATH
gcc tracepulspdk.c -o tracepulspdk -ltrace -I/root/libtrace/ -I/root/libtrace/lib
